## Instructions

Enter in a number into the height and width to create a table of the assigned size. Use the color picker tool to select your color, then clicking on individual cells will color them that color. You can then change the color as many times as needed to create basic pixel art.

## Purpose

This project was set up in order to demonstrate my abilities and knowledge in Javascript and the Document-Object Model interface for the Udacity Intro to Programming nanodegree.
